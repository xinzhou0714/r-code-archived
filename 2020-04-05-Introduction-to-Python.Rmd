# Python Basics

## Hello Python

- General purpose :build anything

- Open source! Free

- Python packages,also for data science
  - Many applications and field
- Version 3x 

```{python}

```
## The Python Interface

**Exercise**

In the Python script on the right, you can type Python code to solve the exercises. If you hit *Run Code* or *Submit Answer*, your python script (`script.py`) is executed and the output is shown in the IPython Shell. *Submit Answer* checks whether your submission is correct and gives you feedback.

You can hit *Run Code* and *Submit Answer* as often as you want. If you're stuck, you can click *Get Hint*, and ultimately *Get Solution*.

You can also use the IPython Shell interactively by simply typing commands and hitting Enter. When you work in the shell directly, your code will not be checked for correctness so it is a great way to experiment.

**Instruction**

- Experiment in the IPython Shell; type `5 / 8`, for example.
- Add another line of code to the Python script on the top-right (not in the Shell): `print(7 + 10)`.
- Hit *Submit Answer* to execute the Python script and receive feedback.



```{python}
# Example, do not modify!
print(5 / 8)
```

```{python}
# Print the sum of 7 and 10
print(7+10)
```


## When to use Python 


**Exercise**

Python is a pretty versatile language. For which applications can you use Python?

**Instructions**

- [ ] You want to do some quick calculations.
- [ ] For your new business, you want to develop a database-driven website.
- [ ] Your boss asks you to clean and analyze the results of the latest satisfaction survey.
- [x] All of the above.



## Any Comments?

**Exercise**

Something that Hugo didn't mention in his videos is that you can add **comments** to your Python scripts. Comments are important to make sure that you and others can understand what your code is about.

To add comments to your Python script, you can use the `#` tag. These comments are not run as Python code, so they will not influence your result. As an example, take the comment on the right, `# Division`; it is completely ignored during execution.

**Instructions**

Above the `print(7 + 10)`, add the comment `# Addition`.

```{python}
# Division
print(5 / 8)
```


```{python}
# Addition
print(7 + 10)
```


## Python as a calculator

**Exercise**

Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as:

- Exponentiation: `**`. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example `4**2` will give `16`.
- Modulo: `%`. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. For example `18 % 7` equals `4`.

The code in the script on the right gives some examples.

**Instructions**

Suppose you have $100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year. After one year, it's 100×1.1=110100×1.1=110 dollars, and after two years it's 100×1.1×1.1=121100×1.1×1.1=121. Add code to calculate how much money you end up with after 7 years, and print the result.

```{python ,eval=FALSE}
# Addition, subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)
print(18 % 7)
print(4 ** 2)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
print(100*1.1**7)
```




## Variables an Types

**Video**

Variable

- Specific, case-sensitive name

- Call up value through variable name

- 1.79 m -68.7Kg


```{python }
height=1.79
weight=68.7
height

```


BMI is defined as:


$$\text{BMI}= \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{height}^2}$$
BMI can be calculatied in python as:

```{python }
#with actual value
68.7/1.79**2
```

```{python }
#with variable name
weight/height**2

```
Reproducibility

```{python }
height=1.79
weight=74.2  #<- 
bmi=weight/height**2
print(bmi)

```


## Variables Assignment

**Exercise**

In Python, a variable allows you to refer to a value with a name. To create a variable use `=`, like this example:

```
x = 5
```

You can now use the name of this variable, `x`, instead of the actual value, `5`.

Remember, `=` in Python means *assignment*, it doesn't test equality!

**Instructions**

- Create a variable `savings` with the value 100.
- Check out this variable by typing `print(savings)` in the script.

```{python }
# Create a variable savings
savings=100
```

```{python }
# Print out savings
print(savings)
```

## Calculation with variables


**Exercise**

Remember how you calculated the money you ended up with after 7 years of investing $100? You did something like this:

```
100 * 1.1 ** 7
```

Instead of calculating with the actual values, you can use variables instead. The `savings` variable you've created in the previous exercise represents the $100 you started with. It's up to you to create a new variable to represent `1.1` and then redo the calculations!



**Instructions**
- Create a variable `growth_multiplier`, equal to `1.1`.
- Create a variable, `result`, equal to the amount of money you saved after `7` years.
- Print out the value of `result`.

```{python }
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable growth_multiplier
growth_multiplier=1.1

# Calculate result
result=savings*growth_multiplier**7
```

```{python }
# Print out result
print(result)

```


## Other variable types


**Exercise**

In the previous exercise, you worked with two Python data types:

- `int`, or integer: a number without a fractional part. `savings`, with the value `100`, is an example of an integer.
- `float`, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. `growth_multiplier`, with the value `1.1`, is an example of a float.

Next to numerical data types, there are two other very common data types:

- `str`, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.
- `bool`, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. Can only be `True` or `False` (the capitalization is important!).

**Instructions**

- Create a new string, `desc`, with the value `"compound interest"`.

- Create a new boolean, `profitable`, with the value `True`.


```{python }
# Create a variable desc
desc="compound interest"

```

```{python }
# Create a variable profitable
profitable=True

```

## Guess the type

**Exercise**

To find out the type of a value or a variable that refers to that value, you can use the [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type) function. Suppose you've defined a variable `a`, but you forgot the type of this variable. To determine the type of `a`, simply execute:

```
type(a)
```

We already went ahead and created three variables: `a`, `b` and `c`. You can use the IPython shell on the right to discover their type. Which of the following options is correct?

```{python include=FALSE}
a=1.2
b="sad"
c=False

```


**Instructions**


```{python }
type(a)

type(b)

type(c)

```

- [ ] `a` is of type `int`, `b` is of type `str`, `c` is of type `bool`
- [ ] `a` is of type `float`, `b` is of type `bool`, `c` is of type `str`
- [x] `a` is of type `float`, `b` is of type `str`, `c` is of type `bool`
- [ ] `a` is of type `int`, `b` is of type `bool`, `c` is of type `str`

## Operations with other types

**Exercise**

Hugo mentioned that different types behave differently in Python.

When you sum two strings, for example, you'll get different behavior than when you sum two integers or two booleans.

In the script some variables with different types have already been created. It's up to you to use them.

**Instructions**

- Calculate the product of `savings` and `growth_multiplier`. Store the result in `year1`.
- What do you think the resulting type will be? Find out by printing out the type of `year1`.
- Calculate the sum of `desc` and `desc` and store the result in a new variable `doubledesc`.
- Print out `doubledesc`. Did you expect this?

```{python }

savings = 100
growth_multiplier = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"

# Assign product of growth_multiplier and savings to year1
year1=savings*growth_multiplier

# Print the type of year1
print(type(year1))
```


```{python }
# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc=desc+desc

# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)

```


## Type conversion

**Exercise**

Using the `+` operator to paste together two strings can be very useful in building custom messages.

Suppose, for example, that you've calculated the return of your investment and want to summarize the results in a string. Assuming the integer `savings` and float `result` are defined, you can try something like this:

```
print("I started with $" + savings + " and now have $" + result + ". Awesome!")
```

This will not work, though, as you cannot simply sum strings and integers/floats.

To fix the error, you'll need to explicitly convert the types of your variables. More specifically, you'll need [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str), to convert a value into a string. `str(savings)`, for example, will convert the integer `savings` to a string.

Similar functions such as [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int), [`float()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) and [`bool()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool) will help you convert Python values into any type.


**Instructions**

- Hit *Run Code* to run the code. Try to understand the error message.
- Fix the code such that the printout runs without errors; use the function [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str) to convert the variables to strings.
- Convert the variable `pi_string` to a float and store this float as a new variable, `pi_float`.


```{python }
# Definition of savings and result
savings = 100
result = 100 * 1.10 ** 7

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(result) + ". Awesome!")

```


```{python }
# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float=float(pi_string)

```


## Can Python handle everything

**Exercise**



Now that you know something more about combining different sources of information, have a look at the four Python expressions below. Which one of these will throw an error? You can always copy and paste this code in the IPython Shell to find out!

**Instructions**

Possible Answers

- [ ] `"I can add integers, like " + str(5) + " to strings."`
- [ ] `"I said " + ("Hey " * 2) + "Hey!"`
  - It's perfectly possible to 'multiply strings' in Python...
- [x] `"The correct answer to this multiple choice exercise is answer number " + 2`
  - Correct! Because you're not converting 2 to a string with `str()`, this will give an error.
- [ ] `True + False`
  - `True + False` doesn't error out. Feel free to try it in the console to confirm!

# Python List


## Python List

**Video**

Python Data Types

- float - real numbers
- int - integer numbers
- str - string, text
+ bool - True, False


Problem

- Data Science: many data point 
- Height of entire family

```{python }
height1=1.73
height2=1.68
height3=1.71
height4=1.89
```

  - inconvenient

we can do this in Python List with square brackets
- `[a, b, c]`
```{python }
[1.73,1.68,1.71,1.89]
```


```{python }
fam=[1.73,1.68,1.71,1.89]
fam
```
- Name a collection of values
- Contain any type
- Contain different types

code example
```{python }
# a list can contain different types
fam=['liz',1.73,"emma",1.68,"mom",1.71,'dad',1.89]
fam
```


```{python }
# lists can contain lists themselves
fam2=[['liz', 1.73],
      ["emma",1.68],
      ["mom",1.71],
      ["dad",1.89]
      ]
fam2
```

List type

```{python }
type(fam)

```



```{python }
type(fam2)

```

Python lists host a bunch of tools to subset and adapt them



## Create a list

**Exercise**

As opposed to `int`, `bool` etc., a list is a **compound data type**; you can group values together:

```
a = "is"
b = "nice"
my_list = ["my", "list", a, b]
```

After measuring the height of your family, you decide to collect some information on the house you're living in. The areas of the different parts of your house are stored in separate variables for now, as shown in the script.

**Instructions**

- Create a list, `areas`, that contains the area of the hallway (`hall`), kitchen (`kit`), living room (`liv`), bedroom (`bed`) and bathroom (`bath`), in this order. Use the predefined variables.
- Print `areas` with the [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) function.

```{python }
# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# Create list areas
areas=[hall,kit,liv,bed,bath]

# Print areas
print(areas)

```



## Create list with different types

**Exercise**

A list can contain any Python type. Although it's not really common, a list can also contain a mix of Python types including strings, floats, booleans, etc.

The printout of the previous exercise wasn't really satisfying. It's just a list of numbers representing the areas, but you can't tell which area corresponds to which part of your house.

The code on the right is the start of a solution. For some of the areas, the name of the corresponding room is already placed in front. Pay attention here! `"bathroom"` is a string, while `bath` is a variable that represents the float `9.50` you specified earlier.


**Instructions**

- Finish the line of code that creates the `areas` list. Build the list so that the list first contains the name of each room as a string and then its area. In other words, add the strings `"hallway"`, `"kitchen"` and `"bedroom"` at the appropriate locations.
- Print `areas` again; is the printout more informative this time?

```{python }
# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# Adapt list areas
areas = ["hallway",hall, "kitchen",kit, "living room", liv,"bedroom" ,bed, "bathroom", bath]

# Print areas
print(areas)

```




## Select the valid list

**Exercise**

A list can contain any Python type. But a list itself is also a Python type. That means that a list can also contain a list! Python is getting funkier by the minute, but fear not, just remember the list syntax:

```
my_list = [el1, el2, el3]
```

Can you tell which ones of the following lines of Python code are valid ways to build a list?

A. `[1, 3, 4, 2]` B. `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 7]]` C. `[1 + 2, "a" * 5, 3]`



**Instructions**

Possible Answers

- [x] A, B and C
- [ ] B
- [ ] B and C
- [ ] C

## List of list

**Exercise**

As a data scientist, you'll often be dealing with a lot of data, and it will make sense to group some of this data.

Instead of creating a flat list containing strings and floats, representing the names and areas of the rooms in your house, you can create a list of lists. The script on the right can already give you an idea.

Don't get confused here: `"hallway"` is a string, while `hall` is a variable that represents the float `11.25` you specified earlier.

**Instructions**

- Finish the list of lists so that it also contains the bedroom and bathroom data. Make sure you enter these in order!
- Print out `house`; does this way of structuring your data make more sense?
- Print out the type of `house`. Are you still dealing with a list?

```{python }
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# house information as list of lists
house = [["hallway", hall],
         ["kitchen", kit],
         ["living room", liv],
         ["bedroom",bed],
         ["bathroom",bath]]

# Print out house
print(house)


```
```{python }

# Print out the type of house
print(type(house))

```

## Subsetting List

**Video**

The first element in the list has index 0 ,the second element has index 1 und so on.
Suppose that you want to select the height of emme, the float 1.68. It's the fourth element ,so it has index 3. To select it ,you use 3 inside square bracket

```{python }
fam=["liz",1.73,"emma",1.68,"mom",1.71,"dad",1.89]
fam
```


```{python }
fam[3]

```

Similarly, to select the string "dad" from the list ,which is the seventh element in the list , you'll need to put the index 6 inside square brackets

```{python }
fam[6]

```
Now the fact ,the index starts at Zero, is called Zero-indexing. 

You can also count backwards, using negative indexes. This is useful if you want to get some elements at the end of your list.

To get your dad's height, for example, you'll need the index -1. These are the negative indexes for all list elements

This means that both these lines return the exact same result.

```{python }
fam[-1]

```


```{python }
fam[7]

```

Apart from indexing, there's also something calles slicing,which allows you to select multiple elements from a list, thus creating a new list.You can do this by specifying a range, using a colon.

Let's first have another look at the list, and then try this piece of code.

```{python }
fam[3:5]

```

Apparently, only the elements with index 3 and 4 get returned, the element with index 5 is not included. In general, this is the syntax :

- the index you specify before the colon, so where the slice starts, is included, 
- while the index you specify after the colon, where the slice ends, is not.

You can also choose to just leave out the index before or after the colon. if you leave out the index where the slice should begin, you're telling Python to start the slice from index 0, like this example.

```{python }
fam[:4]

```

If you leave out the index where the slice should end, you include all elements up to and including the last element in the list, like here

```{python }
fam[5:]

```



## Subset and conquer

**Exercise**

Subsetting Python lists is a piece of cake. Take the code sample below, which creates a list `x` and then selects "b" from it. Remember that this is the second element, so it has index 1. You can also use negative indexing.

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1]
x[-3] # same result!
```

Remember the `areas` list from before, containing both strings and floats? Its definition is already in the script. Can you add the correct code to do some Python subsetting?



**Instructions

- Print out the second element from the `areas` list (it has the value `11.25`).
- Subset and print out the last element of `areas`, being `9.50`. Using a negative index makes sense here!
- Select the number representing the area of the living room (`20.0`) and print it out.




```{python }
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

```



```{python }
# Print out second element from areas
print(areas[1])

```


```{python }
# Print out last element from areas
print(areas[-1])

```

```{python }
# Print out the area of the living room
print(areas[4:6])

```
## Subset and calculate

**Exercise**

After you've extracted values from a list, you can use them to perform additional calculations. Take this example, where the second and fourth element of a list `x` are extracted. The strings that result are pasted together using the `+` operator:

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
print(x[1] + x[3])
```



**Instructions**

- Using a combination of list subsetting and variable assignment, create a new variable, `eat_sleep_area`, that contains the sum of the area of the kitchen and the area of the bedroom.
- Print the new variable `eat_sleep_area`.

```{python }
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Sum of kitchen and bedroom area: eat_sleep_area
eat_sleep_area=areas[3]+areas[-3]

```


```{python }

# Print the variable eat_sleep_area
print(eat_sleep_area)

```




## Slicing and dicing

**Exercise**

Selecting single values from a list is just one part of the story. It's also possible to *slice* your list, which means selecting multiple elements from your list. Use the following syntax:

```
my_list[start:end]
```

The `start` index will be included, while the `end` index is *not*.

The code sample below shows an example. A list with `"b"` and `"c"`, corresponding to indexes 1 and 2, are selected from a list `x`:

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1:3]
```

The elements with index 1 and 2 are included, while the element with index 3 is not.



**Instructions**

- Use slicing to create a list, `downstairs`, that contains the first 6 elements of `areas`.
- Do a similar thing to create a new variable, `upstairs`, that contains the last 4 elements of `areas`.
- Print both `downstairs` and `upstairs` using [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print).


```{python}
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Use slicing to create downstairs
downstairs=areas[0:6]

# Use slicing to create upstairs
upstairs=areas[6:10]
```


```{python}
# Print out downstairs and upstairs
print(downstairs)

```

```{python}
print(upstairs)
```





## Slicing and dicing(2) 

**Exercise**

In the video, Hugo first discussed the syntax where you specify both where to begin and end the slice of your list:

```
my_list[begin:end]
```

However, it's also possible not to specify these indexes. If you don't specify the `begin` index, Python figures out that you want to start your slice at the beginning of your list. If you don't specify the `end` index, the slice will go all the way to the last element of your list. To experiment with this, try the following commands in the IPython Shell:

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[:2]
x[2:]
x[:]
```


**Instructions**

- Create `downstairs` again, as the first `6` elements of `areas`. This time, simplify the slicing by omitting the `begin` index.
- Create `upstairs` again, as the last `4` elements of `areas`. This time, simplify the slicing by omitting the `end` index.

```{python}
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Alternative slicing to create downstairs
downstairs=areas[:6]

# Alternative slicing to create upstairs
upstairs=areas[-4:]
```




## Subsetting list of lists


**Exercise**

You saw before that a Python list can contain practically anything; even other lists! To subset lists of lists, you can use the same technique as before: square brackets. Try out the commands in the following code sample in the IPython Shell:

```
x = [["a", "b", "c"],
     ["d", "e", "f"],
     ["g", "h", "i"]]
x[2][0]
x[2][:2]
```

`x[2]` results in a list, that you can subset again by adding additional square brackets.

What will `house[-1][1]` return? `house`, the list of lists that you created before, is already defined for you in the workspace. You can experiment with it in the IPython Shell.


**Instructions**

```{python}
house=[['hallway', 11.25],
      ['kitchen', 18.0],
      ['living room', 20.0],
      ['bedroom', 10.75],
      ['bathroom', 9.5]]
```

```{python}
house[-1][1]
```


- [ ] A float: the kitchen area
- [ ] A string: `"kitchen"`
- [x] A float: the bathroom area
- [ ] A string: `"bathroom"`


## Manipulating List


**Video**

List Manipulation

- Change List elements
- Add list elements
- Remove list elements


```{python}
fam=["liz",1.73,"emma",1.68,"mom",1.71,"dad",1.89]
fam
```


Change List elements

an element
```{python}
fam[7]=1.86
fam
```


a range of elments
```{python}
fam[0:2]=["lisa",1.74]
fam

```


Suppose you want to add your own name and height to fam Height list. This will do the trick

```{python}
fam+["me",1.79]
```


Of course, you can also store this new list in a variable, fam_ext for example
```{python}
fam_ext=fam+["me",1.79]
```

Finally, deleting elements from a list is also pretty straightforward, you'll have to use `del()` here. Take this line, for example, that deletes the element with index 2, that is "emma" from the list,if you check out `fam` now, you'll  see that the "emma" string is gone

```{python}
del(fam[2])
fam
```

Because you've removed an index, all elements that came after "emma" scooted over by one index. If you run the same line again, you'removing element at index 2, which is emma's height ,1.68 meters now.


```{python}
del(fam[2])
fam
```

**Behind the scenes (1)** 

What actually happens when you create a new list x, like this?

```{python}
x=["a","b","c"]
```

Well, in a simplified sense, you're storing a list in memory, and store the 'address' of that list, so where the list is in your computer memory, in x. This means that x does not actually contain all the list elements, it rather contains a reference to the list. For basic operations, the difference is not that important, but it becomes more so when you start copying list. 

Let me clarify this with an example. Let's store the list x as a new varible y, by simply using the equal sign. 

We change the element with index 1 in the list y, like this 
```{python}
x=["a","b","c"]
y=x
y[1]="z"
y

```
The funky thing is that if you check out x again, also here the second element was changed.
```{python}
x
```
That's because when you copied x to y with the equal sign, you copie the reference to the list, not the actual values themselves.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xinzhou0714/ImgHosting/master/blog_PicBed/list-assignment-in-python.png)

When you're updating an element the list, it's one and the same list in the computer memory your changing. Both x and y point to this list, so the update is visible from both variables.

**Behind the scenes (2)**

If you want to create a list y that point to a new list in the memory with the same values, you need to use something else the the euqals sign.

You can use the `list()` function


```{python}
x=["a","b","c"]
y=list(x)

```

or slicing to select all list elements explicitly.

```{python}
y=x[:]
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xinzhou0714/ImgHosting/master/blog_PicBed/list-assignment-in-python2.png)

If you now make a change to the list y points to, x is not affected.
```{python}
y[1]="z"
x
```

## Replace list elements

**Exercise**
Replacing list elements is pretty easy. Simply subset the list and assign new values to the subset. You can select single elements or you can change entire list slices at once.

Use the IPython Shell to experiment with the commands below. Can you tell what's happening and why?

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1] = "r"
x[2:] = ["s", "t"]
```

For this and the following exercises, you'll continue working on the `areas` list that contains the names and areas of different rooms in a house.


**Instructions**

- Update the area of the bathroom area to be 10.50 square meters instead of 9.50.
- Make the `areas` list more trendy! Change `"living room"` to `"chill zone"`.

```{python}
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

```


```{python}
# Correct the bathroom area
areas[-1]=10.5
```


```{python}
# Change "living room" to "chill zone"
areas[4]="chill zone"
```


## Extend a list

**Exercise**

If you can change elements in a list, you sure want to be able to add elements to it, right? You can use the `+` operator:

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
y = x + ["e", "f"]
```

You just won the lottery, awesome! You decide to build a poolhouse and a garage. Can you add the information to the `areas` list?


**Instructions**

- Use the `+` operator to paste the list `["poolhouse", 24.5]` to the end of the `areas` list. Store the resulting list as `areas_1`.
- Further extend `areas_1` by adding data on your garage. Add the string `"garage"` and float `15.45`. Name the resulting list `areas_2`.

```{python}
# Create the areas list
# Create the areas list and make some changes
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "chill zone", 20.0,
         "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 10.50]

```

```{python}
# Add poolhouse data to areas, new list is areas_1
areas_1=areas+["poolhouse", 24.5]
areas_1
```


```{python}
# Add garage data to areas_1, new list is areas_2
areas_2=areas_1+["garage",15.45]
areas_2
```

## Delete list elements

**Exercise**

Finally, you can also remove elements from your list. You can do this with the `del` statement:

```
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
del(x[1])
```

Pay attention here: as soon as you remove an element from a list, the indexes of the elements that come after the deleted element all change!

The updated and extended version of `areas` that you've built in the previous exercises is coded below. You can copy and paste this into the IPython Shell to play around with the result.

```
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0,
        "chill zone", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75,
         "bathroom", 10.50, "poolhouse", 24.5,
         "garage", 15.45]
```

There was a mistake! The amount you won with the lottery is not that big after all and it looks like the poolhouse isn't going to happen. You decide to remove the corresponding string and float from the `areas` list.

The `;` sign is used to place commands on the same line. The following two code chunks are equivalent:

```
# Same line
command1; command2

# Separate lines
command1
command2
```

Which of the code chunks will do the job for us?


**Instructions**

- [ ]`del(areas[10]); del(areas[11])`
- [ ]`del(areas[10:11])`
- [x]`del(areas[-4:-2])`
- [ ]`del(areas[-3]); del(areas[-4])`



## Inner working of lists

**Exercise**

At the end of the video, Hugo explained how Python lists work behind the scenes. In this exercise you'll get some hands-on experience with this.

The Python code in the script already creates a list with the name `areas` and a copy named `areas_copy`. Next, the first element in the `areas_copy` list is changed and the `areas` list is printed out. If you hit *Run Code* you'll see that, although you've changed `areas_copy`, the change also takes effect in the `areas` list. That's because `areas` and `areas_copy` point to the same list.

If you want to prevent changes in `areas_copy` from also taking effect in `areas`, you'll have to do a more explicit copy of the `areas` list. You can do this with [`list()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list) or by using `[:]`.


**Instructions**

Change the second command, that creates the variable `areas_copy`, such that `areas_copy` is an explicit copy of `areas`. After your edit, changes made to `areas_copy` shouldn't affect `areas`. Hit *Submit Answer* to check this.

```{python}
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Create areas_copy
areas_copy = areas[:]

# Change areas_copy
areas_copy[0] = 5.0

# Print areas
print(areas)
```



# Functions and Packages



## Functions 

**Video**

Funktions

- Nothing new
- type()
- Piece of reusable code
- Solves particular task
- Call function instead of writing code youtself


example

- build-in function:`max()`
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xinzhou0714/ImgHosting/master/blog_PicBed/py-function-max.png)

```{python}
fam=[1.73,1.68,1.71,1.89]
fam
```


we simply pass fam to max inside parentheses
```{python}
max(fam)

```

- build-in function:`round()`

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xinzhou0714/ImgHosting/master/blog_PicBed/py-function-round.png)

```{python}
round(1.68,1)
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xinzhou0714/ImgHosting/master/blog_PicBed/py-function-round2.png)

```{python}
round(1.68,)
```

```{python}
help(round)   # Open up documentation
```


```{python}

```


## Familiar functions

**Exercise**

Out of the box, Python offers a bunch of built-in functions to make your life as a data scientist easier. You already know two such functions: [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) and [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type). You've also used the functions [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str), [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int), [`bool()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool) and [`float()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) to switch between data types. These are built-in functions as well.

Calling a function is easy. To get the type of `3.0` and store the output as a new variable, `result`, you can use the following:

```
result = type(3.0)
```

The general recipe for calling functions and saving the result to a variable is thus:

```
output = function_name(input)
```

**Instructions**

- Use [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) in combination with [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type) to print out the type of `var1`.
- Use [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len) to get the length of the list `var1`. Wrap it in a [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) call to directly print it out.
- Use [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int) to convert `var2` to an integer. Store the output as `out2`.

```{python}
# Create variables var1 and var2
var1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
var2 = True
```

```{python}
# Print out type of var1
print(type(var1))
```

```{python}
# Print out length of var1
print(len(var1))
```


```{python}
# Convert var2 to an integer: out2
out2=int(var2)
```
## Help!

**Exercise**

Maybe you already know the name of a Python function, but you still have to figure out how to use it. Ironically, you have to ask for information about a function with another function: [`help()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help). In IPython specifically, you can also use `?` before the function name.

To get help on the [`max()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max) function, for example, you can use one of these calls:

```
help(max)
?max
```

Use the Shell on the right to open up the documentation on [`complex()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#complex). Which of the following statements is true?

**Instructions**



- [ ] [`complex()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#complex) takes exactly two arguments: `real` and `[, imag]`.
- [ ] [`complex()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#complex) takes two arguments: `real` and `imag`. Both these arguments are required.
- [x] [`complex()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#complex) takes two arguments: `real` and `imag`. `real` is a required argument, `imag` is an optional argument.
- [ ] [`complex()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#complex) takes two arguments: `real` and `imag`. If you don't specify `imag`, it is set to 1 by Python.

```{python }
help(complex)
```

## Multiple arguments

**Exercise**

In the previous exercise, the square brackets around `imag` in the documentation showed us that the `imag` argument is optional. But Python also uses a different way to tell users about arguments being optional.

Have a look at the documentation of [`sorted()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted) by typing `help(sorted)` in the IPython Shell.

You'll see that [`sorted()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted) takes three arguments: `iterable`, `key` and `reverse`.

`key=None` means that if you don't specify the `key` argument, it will be `None`. `reverse=False` means that if you don't specify the `reverse` argument, it will be `False`.

In this exercise, you'll only have to specify `iterable` and `reverse`, not `key`. The first input you pass to [`sorted()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted) will be matched to the `iterable` argument, but what about the second input? To tell Python you want to specify `reverse` without changing anything about `key`, you can use `=`:

```
sorted(___, reverse = ___)
```

Two lists have been created for you on the right. Can you paste them together and sort them in descending order?

Note: For now, we can understand an [*iterable*](https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-iterable) as being any collection of objects, e.g. a List.


**Instructions**

- Use `+` to merge the contents of `first` and `second` into a new list: `full`.
- Call [`sorted()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted) on `full` and specify the `reverse` argument to be `True`. Save the sorted list as `full_sorted`.
- Finish off by printing out `full_sorted`.

```{python}
help(sorted)

```

```{python}

# Create lists first and second
first = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0]
second = [10.75, 9.50]

# Paste together first and second: full
full=first+second

# Sort full in descending order: full_sorted
full_sorted=sorted(full,reverse=True)
```

```{python}
# Print out full_sorted
print(full_sorted)

```



## Methods

**Video**

list methods


```{python}
fam=['liz',1.73,'emma',1.68,'mom',1.71,'dad',1.89]

```



```{python}

fam.index("mom")  #Call method index() on fam
```
```{python}

fam.count(1.73)
```


```{python}

fam.append("me")
fam
```

```{python}

fam.append(1.79 )
fam
```
str methods

```{python}
sister="liz"
```


```{python}
sister.capitalize()
```

```{python}
sister.replace("z","sa")
```

In python ,everything is an object, and each object has specific methods associated. Depending on the type of the object, list, string, float, whatever the available methods are different.


## String Methods


**Exercise**

Strings come with a bunch of methods. Follow the instructions closely to discover some of them. If you want to discover them in more detail, you can always type `help(str)` in the IPython Shell.

A string `place` has already been created for you to experiment with.

**Instructions**


- Use the [`upper()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.upper) method on `place` and store the result in `place_up`. Use the syntax for calling methods that you learned in the previous video.
- Print out `place` and `place_up`. Did both change?
- Print out the number of o's on the variable `place` by calling [`count()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count) on `place` and passing the letter `'o'` as an input to the method. We're talking about the variable `place`, not the word `"place"`!

```{python}
# string to experiment with: place
place = "poolhouse"
```


```{python}
# Use upper() on place: place_up
place_up=place.upper()
```


```{python}
# Print out place and place_up
print(place)
```

```{python}

print(place_up)
```

```{python}
# Print out the number of o's in place
print(place.count("o"))

```

## List Methods

**Exercise**

Strings are not the only Python types that have methods associated with them. Lists, floats, integers and booleans are also types that come packaged with a bunch of useful methods. In this exercise, you'll be experimenting with:

- [`index()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.index), to get the index of the first element of a list that matches its input and
- [`count()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count), to get the number of times an element appears in a list.

You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of a house: `areas`.

**Instructions**

- Use the [`index()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.index) method to get the index of the element in `areas` that is equal to `20.0`. Print out this index.
- Call [`count()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count) on `areas` to find out how many times `9.50` appears in the list. Again, simply print out this number.



```{python}
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

```


```{python}
# Print out the index of the element 20.0
print(areas.index(20.0))

```


```{python}
# Print out how often 9.50 appears in areas
print(areas.count(9.50))

```
## List Methods(2)


**Exercise**

Most list methods will change the list they're called on. Examples are:

- [`append()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable), that adds an element to the list it is called on,
- [`remove()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable), that removes the first element of a list that matches the input, and
- [`reverse()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable), that reverses the order of the elements in the list it is called on.

You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of the house: `areas`.

**Instructions**

- Use [`append()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable) twice to add the size of the poolhouse and the garage again: `24.5` and `15.45`, respectively. Make sure to add them in this order.
- Print out `areas`
- Use the [`reverse()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable) method to reverse the order of the elements in `areas`.
- Print out `areas` once more.



```{python}
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Use append twice to add poolhouse and garage size
areas.append(24.5)
areas.append(15.45)


```



```{python}
# Print out areas
print(areas)

```


```{python}
# Reverse the orders of the elements in areas
areas.reverse()

# Print out areas
print(areas)

```


## Packages

Packages

- Directory of Python Scripts
- Each script = module
- Specify function, methods, types
- Thousands of packages available
  - NumPy
    - Scientific calculation 
  - Matplotlib
    - data visualization
  - Scikit-learn
    - machine learning

```{python}
import numpy
#array([1,2,3])   #It does not work like this

```


```{python}
import numpy
numpy.array([1,2,3])
```


```{python}
import numpy as np
np.array([1,2,3])
```


```{python}
from numpy import array
array([1,2,3])
```
## Import package

**Exercise**

As a data scientist, some notions of geometry never hurt. Let's refresh some of the basics.

For a fancy clustering algorithm, you want to find the circumference, CC, and area, AA, of a circle. When the radius of the circle is `r`, you can calculate CC and AA as:



$$C=2\pi r$$

$$A=\pi r^2$$



To use the constant `pi`, you'll need the `math` package. A variable `r` is already coded in the script. Fill in the code to calculate `C` and `A` and see how the [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) functions create some nice printouts.


**Instructions**

- Import the `math` package. Now you can access the constant `pi` with `math.pi`.
- Calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in `C`.
- Calculate the area of the circle and store it in `A`.

```{python}
# Definition of radius
r = 0.43

# Import the math package
import math

# Calculate C
C = 2* math.pi *r

# Calculate A
A = math.pi * r**2

```


```{python}
print("Circumference: " + str(C))

```


```{python}

print("Area: " + str(A))

```


## Selective import

**Exercise**

General imports, like `import math`, make **all** functionality from the `math` package available to you. However, if you decide to only use a specific part of a package, you can always make your import more selective:

```
from math import pi
```

Let's say the Moon's orbit around planet Earth is a perfect circle, with a radius `r` (in km) that is defined in the script.


**Instructions**

- Perform a selective import from the `math` package where you only import the `radians` function.
- Calculate the distance travelled by the Moon over 12 degrees of its orbit. Assign the result to `dist`. You can calculate this as ` r * phi`, where `r` is the radius and `phi` is the angle in radians. To convert an angle in degrees to an angle in radians, use the [`radians()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.radians) function, which you just imported.

- Print out `dist`.


```{python}
# Definition of radius
r = 192500

# Import radians function of math package
from math import radians 

# Travel distance of Moon over 12 degrees. Store in dist.
dist=r * radians(12)

```

```{python}
# Print out dist
print(dist)

```


## Different ways of importing

**Exercise**

There are several ways to import packages and modules into Python. Depending on the import call, you'll have to use different Python code.

Suppose you want to use the function [`inv()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.inv.html), which is in the `linalg` subpackage of the `scipy` package. You want to be able to use this function as follows:

```
my_inv([[1,2], [3,4]])
```

Which `import` statement will you need in order to run the above code without an error?

**Instructions**

- [ ] `import scipy`
- [ ] `import scipy.linalg`
- [ ] `from scipy.linalg import my_inv`
- [x] `from scipy.linalg import inv as my_inv`

## Your First NumPy  Array

**Exercise**

In this chapter, we're going to dive into the world of baseball. Along the way, you'll get comfortable with the basics of `numpy`, a powerful package to do data science.

A list `baseball` has already been defined in the Python script, representing the height of some baseball players in centimeters. Can you add some code here and there to create a `numpy` array from it?

**Instructions**

- Import the `numpy` package as `np`, so that you can refer to `numpy` with `np`.
- Use [`np.array()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/glossary.html#term-array) to create a `numpy` array from `baseball`. Name this array `np_baseball`.
- Print out the type of `np_baseball` to check that you got it right.

```{python}
# Create list baseball
baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]

# Import the numpy package as np
import  numpy  as np

# Create a numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball=np.array(baseball)

```


```{python}
# Print out type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))

```

## Baseball players' height

**Exercise**

You are a huge baseball fan. You decide to call the MLB (Major League Baseball) and ask around for some more statistics on the height of the main players. They pass along data on more than a thousand players, which is stored as a regular Python list: `height_in`. The height is expressed in inches. Can you make a `numpy` array out of it and convert the units to meters?

`height_in` is already available and the `numpy` package is loaded, so you can start straight away (Source: [stat.ucla.edu](http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_Data_MLB_HeightsWeights)).



**Instructions**

- Create a `numpy` array from `height_in`. Name this new array `np_height_in`.
- Print `np_height_in`.
- Multiply `np_height_in` with `0.0254` to convert all height measurements from inches to meters. Store the new values in a new array, `np_height_m`.
- Print out `np_height_m` and check if the output makes sense.



```{python eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
height_in=[74, 74, 72, 72, 73, 69, 69, 71, 76, 71, 73, 73, 74, 74, 69, 70, 73, 75]
weight_lb=[180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200, 231, 180, 188, 180, 185, 160, 180, 185, 189,185]

```





```{python}

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array from height_in: np_height_in
np_height_in=np.array(height_in)

# Print out np_height_in
print(np_height_in)

```


```{python}

# Convert np_height_in to m: np_height_m
np_height_m=np_height_in*0.0254

# Print np_height_m
print(np_height_m)
```

## Baseball player's BMI

**Exercise**

The MLB also offers to let you analyze their weight data. Again, both are available as regular Python lists: `height_in` and `weight_lb`. `height_in` is in inches and `weight_lb` is in pounds.

It's now possible to calculate the BMI of each baseball player. Python code to convert `height_in` to a `numpy` array with the correct units is already available in the workspace. Follow the instructions step by step and finish the game!


**Instructions**

- Create a `numpy` array from the `weight_lb` list with the correct units. Multiply by `0.453592` to go from pounds to kilograms. Store the resulting `numpy` array as `np_weight_kg`.

- Use `np_height_m` and `np_weight_kg` to calculate the BMI of each player. Use the following equation:

$$
BMI= \frac{weight \; (\text{kg})}{(height \; (\text{m}))^2}
$$

- Save the resulting`numpy` array as`bmi`

- Print out `bmi`.


```{python}
# height and weight are available as regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create array from height_in with metric units: np_height_m
np_height_m = np.array(height_in) * 0.0254

# Create array from weight_lb with metric units: np_weight_kg
np_weight_kg=np.array(weight_lb) * 0.453592

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
bmi=np_weight_kg/np_height_m**2

```


```{python}

# Print out bmi
print(bmi)

## Lightweight baseball players

**Exercise**

To subset both regular Python lists and `numpy` arrays, you can use square brackets:

```
x = [4 , 9 , 6, 3, 1]
x[1]
import numpy as np
y = np.array(x)
y[1]
```

For `numpy` specifically, you can also use boolean `numpy` arrays:

```
high = y > 5
y[high]
```

The code that calculates the BMI of all baseball players is already included. Follow the instructions and reveal interesting things from the data!



**Instructions**

- Create a boolean `numpy` array: the element of the array should be `True` if the corresponding baseball player's BMI is below 21. You can use the `<` operator for this. Name the array `light`.
- Print the array `light`.
- Print out a `numpy` array with the BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21. Use `light` inside square brackets to do a selection on the `bmi` array.


```{python}
# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
np_height_m = np.array(height_in) * 0.0254
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight_lb) * 0.453592
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

```



```{python}

# Create the light array
light=bmi<21

# Print out light
print(light)
```



```{python}
# Print out BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21
print(bmi[light])

```

## NUmPy Side Effects

**Exercise**

As Hugo explained before, `numpy` is great for doing vector arithmetic. If you compare its functionality with regular Python lists, however, some things have changed.

First of all, `numpy` arrays cannot contain elements with different types. If you try to build such a list, some of the elements' types are changed to end up with a homogeneous list. This is known as *type coercion*.

Second, the typical arithmetic operators, such as `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` have a different meaning for regular Python lists and `numpy` arrays.

Have a look at this line of code:

```{python}
np.array([True, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, False])
```

Can you tell which code chunk builds the exact same Python object? The `numpy` package is already imported as `np`, so you can start experimenting in the IPython Shell straight away!


**Instructions**

- [ ] `np.array([True, 1, 2, 3, 4, False])`
- [X] `np.array([4, 3, 0]) + np.array([0, 2, 2])`
  - Great job! True is converted to 1, False is converted to 0.
- [ ] `np.array([1, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, -1])`
- [ ] `np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`

## Subsetting NumPy Arrays

**Exercise**

You've seen it with your own eyes: Python lists and `numpy` arrays sometimes behave differently. Luckily, there are still certainties in this world. For example, subsetting (using the square bracket notation on lists or arrays) works exactly the same. To see this for yourself, try the following lines of code in the IPython Shell:

```
x = ["a", "b", "c"]
x[1]

np_x = np.array(x)
np_x[1]
```

The script on the right already contains code that imports `numpy` as `np`, and stores both the height and weight of the MLB players as `numpy` arrays.

**Instructions**

- Subset `np_weight_lb` by printing out the element at index 50.
- Print out a sub-array of `np_height_in` that contains the elements at index 100 up to **and including** index 110.

```{python eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Store weight and height lists as numpy arrays
np_weight_lb = np.array(weight_lb)
np_height_in = np.array(height_in)

# Print out the weight at index 50
print(np_weight_lb[50])

# Print out sub-array of np_height_in: index 100 up to and including index 110
print(np_height_in[100:111])

```

## 2D Numpy Arrays

**Video**

Type of Numpy Array

```{python}
import numpy as np
np_height=np.array([1.73,1.68,1.71,1.89,1.79])
np_weight=np.array([65.4,59.2,63.6,88.4,68.7])

```

If you ask for the type of these arrays,Python tells you that they are `numpy.ndarray`. This type is defined in the numpy package.

`numpy.ndarray` stands for n-dimensional array.

```{python}
type(np_height)

```

```{python}
type(np_weight)

```


The arrays `np_height`,`np_weight` are one-dimensional arrays,but it's perfectly possible to create 2 dimensional, three dimensional, heck even seven dimensional arrays!


2D Numpy Arrays

You can create a 2D numpy array from a regular Python list of lists

```{python}
np_2d=np.array([
[1.73,1.68,1.71,1.89,1.79],
[65.4,59.2,63.6,88.4,68.7]
])

np_2d

```

From `np_2d.shape` you can see that we indeed have 2 rows and 5 columns.

```{python}
np_2d.shape
```

If you change one of float to be string, all the array elements will be coerced to strings, to end up with a homogeneous array.


```{python}
np.array([
[1.73,1.68,1.71,1.89,1.79],
[65.4,59.2,63.6,88.4,"68.7"]
])

```

You can think of the 2D numpy array as an improved list of list : you can perform calculations on the arrays on the arrays, like  I showed  before, and you can do more advanced way of subsetting

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xinzhou0714/ImgHosting/master/blog_PicBed/subsetting-ndarray-visual.png)


Suppose you want the first row, and  then the third  element in that row.

To select the row you need the index 0 in the square brackets.(Don't forget about the zero indexing). To then select the third element, you can extend the same call with another pair of brackets, this time with the index 2. Basically you're the selecting the row, and then from that row do another selection.

```{python}
np_2d[0]
```

```{python}
np_2d[0][2]
```

There's also an alternative way of subsetting, using single square brackets and a comma. This call returns the exact same value as before. The value before the comma specifies the row, the value after the comma specifies the column. The intersection of the rows and columns you specified, are returned.
```{python}
np_2d[0,2]
```


Suppose you want to select the height and weight of the second and third family member. You want both rows, so you put in a colon before the comma. You only want the second and third column, so you put in the index 1 to 3 after the comma. 

```{python}
np_2d[:,1:3]
```

Remember that the third index is not included here. The intersection gives us a 2D array with 2 rows and 2 columns.

Similarly, you can select the weight of all family members like this: you only want the second row, so put 1 before the comma. You want all columns, so you use a colon after the comma. The intersection gives us the entire second row.
```{python}
np_2d[1,:]
```

Finally, 2D numpy arrays enable you to do element-wise calculations, the same way you did it with 1D numpy arrays.

## Your First 2D Numpy Array


**Exercise**

Before working on the actual MLB data, let's try to create a 2D `numpy` array from a small list of lists.

In this exercise, `baseball` is a list of lists. The main list contains 4 elements. Each of these elements is a list containing the height and the weight of 4 baseball players, in this order. `baseball` is already coded for you in the script.

**Instructions**

- Use [`np.array()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/glossary.html#term-array) to create a 2D `numpy` array from `baseball`. Name it `np_baseball`.
- Print out the type of `np_baseball`.
- Print out the `shape` attribute of `np_baseball`. Use `np_baseball.shape`.

```{python}
# Create baseball, a list of lists
baseball = [[180, 78.4],
            [215, 102.7],
            [210, 98.5],
            [188, 75.2]]

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball=np.array(baseball)

```


```{python}
# Print out the type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))

```


```{python}
# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print(np_baseball.shape)

```

## Baseball data in 2D form


**Exercise**

You have another look at the MLB data and realize that it makes more sense to restructure all this information in a 2D `numpy` array. This array should have 1015 rows, corresponding to the 1015 baseball players you have information on, and 2 columns (for height and weight).

The MLB was, again, very helpful and passed you the data in a different structure, a Python list of lists. In this list of lists, each sublist represents the height and weight of a single baseball player. The name of this embedded list is `baseball`.

Can you store the data as a 2D array to unlock `numpy`'s extra functionality?

**Instructions**

- Use [`np.array()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/glossary.html#term-array) to create a 2D `numpy` array from `baseball`. Name it `np_baseball`.
- Print out the `shape` attribute of `np_baseball`


```{python eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# baseball is available as a regular list of lists

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball=np.array(baseball)

# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print(np_baseball.shape)

```




## Subsetting 2D Numpy Arrays


**Exercise**

If your 2D `numpy` array has a regular structure, i.e. each row and column has a fixed number of values, complicated ways of subsetting become very easy. Have a look at the code below where the elements `"a"` and `"c"` are extracted from a list of lists.

```
# regular list of lists
x = [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]
[x[0][0], x[1][0]]

# numpy
import numpy as np
np_x = np.array(x)
np_x[:,0]
```

For regular Python lists, this is a real pain. For 2D `numpy` arrays, however, it's pretty intuitive! The indexes before the comma refer to the rows, while those after the comma refer to the columns. The `:` is for slicing; in this example, it tells Python to include all rows.

The code that converts the pre-loaded `baseball` list to a 2D `numpy` array is already in the script. The first column contains the players' height in inches and the second column holds player weight, in pounds. Add some lines to make the correct selections. Remember that in Python, the first element is at index 0!


**Instructions**

- Print out the 50th row of `np_baseball`.
- Make a new variable, `np_weight_lb`, containing the entire second column of `np_baseball`.
- Select the height (first column) of the 124th baseball player in `np_baseball` and print it out.

```{python eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# baseball is available as a regular list of lists

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (2 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball
print(np_baseball[49])

# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight_lb
np_weight_lb=np_baseball[:,1]

# Print out height of 124th player
print(np_baseball[123,0])

```



## 2D Arithmetic


**Exercise**

Remember how you calculated the Body Mass Index for all baseball players? `numpy` was able to perform all calculations element-wise (i.e. element by element). For 2D `numpy` arrays this isn't any different! You can combine matrices with single numbers, with vectors, and with other matrices.

Execute the code below in the IPython shell and see if you understand:

```
import numpy as np
np_mat = np.array([[1, 2],
                   [3, 4],
                   [5, 6]])
np_mat * 2
np_mat + np.array([10, 10])
np_mat + np_mat
```

`np_baseball` is coded for you; it's again a 2D `numpy` array with 3 columns representing height (in inches), weight (in pounds) and age (in years).

**Instructions**

- You managed to get hold of the changes in height, weight and age of all baseball players. It is available as a 2D `numpy` array, `updated`. Add `np_baseball` and `updated` and print out the result.
- You want to convert the units of height and weight to metric (meters and kilograms respectively). As a first step, create a `numpy` array with three values: `0.0254`, `0.453592` and `1`. Name this array `conversion`.
- Multiply `np_baseball` with `conversion` and print out the result.



```{python eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# baseball is available as a regular list of lists
# updated is available as 2D numpy array

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (3 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and updated
print(np_baseball+updated)

# Create numpy array: conversion
conversion=np.array([0.0254,0.453592,1])

# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion
print(np_baseball*conversion)

```


## Numpy: Basic Statistics

**Video**


```{python}
#np.mean()
#np.median()
#np.corrcoef()
#np.std()

```


We sampled two random distributions 5000 times to create the height and weight arrays,and then used column_stack to paste them together as two columns

```{python}
height=np.round(np.random.normal(1.75,2,5000),2)
height
```

```{python}
weight=np.round(np.random.normal(60.32,15,5000),2)
weight

```



```{python}
np_city=np.column_stack((height,weight))
np_city
```
## Average versus median

**Exercise**

You now know how to use `numpy` functions to get a better feeling for your data. It basically comes down to importing `numpy` and then calling several simple functions on the `numpy` arrays:

```
import numpy as np
x = [1, 4, 8, 10, 12]
np.mean(x)
np.median(x)
```

The baseball data is available as a 2D `numpy` array with 3 columns (height, weight, age) and 1015 rows. The name of this `numpy` array is `np_baseball`. After restructuring the data, however, you notice that some height values are abnormally high. Follow the instructions and discover which summary statistic is best suited if you're dealing with so-called *outliers*.


**Instructions**

- Create `numpy` array `np_height_in` that is equal to first column of `np_baseball`.
- Print out the mean of `np_height_in`.
- Print out the median of `np_height_in`.


```{python eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# np_baseball is available

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create np_height_in from np_baseball
np_height_in=np_baseball[:,0]

# Print out the mean of np_height_in
print(np.mean(np_height_in))

# Print out the median of np_height_in
print(np.median(np_height_in))

```



## Explore the baseball data


**Exercise**

Because the mean and median are so far apart, you decide to complain to the MLB. They find the error and send the corrected data over to you. It's again available as a 2D Numpy array `np_baseball`, with three columns.

The Python script on the right already includes code to print out informative messages with the different summary statistics. Can you finish the job?



**Instructions**

- The code to print out the mean height is already included. Complete the code for the median height. Replace `None` with the correct code.
- Use [`np.std()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.std.html) on the first column of `np_baseball` to calculate `stddev`. Replace `None` with the correct code.
- Do big players tend to be heavier? Use [`np.corrcoef()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.corrcoef.html) to store the correlation between the first and second column of `np_baseball` in `corr`. Replace `None` with the correct code.



```{python eval=FALSE, include=TRUE }

# np_baseball is available

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Print mean height (first column)
avg = np.mean(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Average: " + str(avg))

# Print median height. Replace 'None'
med = np.median(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Median: " + str(med))

# Print out the standard deviation on height. Replace 'None'
stddev = np.std(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Standard Deviation: " + str(stddev))

# Print out correlation between first and second column. Replace 'None'
corr = np.corrcoef(np_baseball[:,0],np_baseball[:,1])
print("Correlation: " + str(corr))

```



## Blend it all together

**Exercise**


In the last few exercises you've learned everything there is to know about heights and weights of baseball players. Now it's time to dive into another sport: soccer.

You've contacted FIFA for some data and they handed you two lists. The lists are the following:

```
positions = ['GK', 'M', 'A', 'D', ...]
heights = [191, 184, 185, 180, ...]
```

Each element in the lists corresponds to a player. The first list, `positions`, contains strings representing each player's position. The possible positions are: `'GK'` (goalkeeper), `'M'` (midfield), `'A'` (attack) and `'D'` (defense). The second list, `heights`, contains integers representing the height of the player in cm. The first player in the lists is a goalkeeper and is pretty tall (191 cm).

You're fairly confident that the median height of goalkeepers is higher than that of other players on the soccer field. Some of your friends don't believe you, so you are determined to show them using the data you received from FIFA and your newly acquired Python skills.

**Instructions**

- Convert `heights` and `positions`, which are regular lists, to numpy arrays. Call them `np_heights` and `np_positions`.
- Extract all the heights of the goalkeepers. You can use a little trick here: use `np_positions == 'GK'` as an index for `np_heights`. Assign the result to `gk_heights`.
- Extract all the heights of all the other players. This time use `np_positions != 'GK'` as an index for `np_heights`. Assign the result to `other_heights`.
- Print out the median height of the goalkeepers using [`np.median()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.median.html). Replace `None` with the correct code.
- Do the same for the other players. Print out their median height. Replace `None` with the correct code.



```{python eval=FALSE, include=TRUE }
# heights and positions are available as lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Convert positions and heights to numpy arrays: np_positions, np_heights
np_heights=np.array(heights)
np_positions=np.array(positions)

# Heights of the goalkeepers: gk_heights
gk_heights=np_heights[np_positions == 'GK']

# Heights of the other players: other_heights
other_heights=np_heights[np_positions != 'GK']

# Print out the median height of goalkeepers. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of goalkeepers: " + str(np.median(gk_heights)))

# Print out the median height of other players. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of other players: " + str(np.median(other_heights)))

```
